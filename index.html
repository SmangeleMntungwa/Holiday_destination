    <h2>Greetings family, as we all know our annual family trip is long overdue. 
        We have battled and conquered the long faught battle of COVID 19.
    I believe we ALL need and deserve a break and some time away for us to rebuild our bonds with each other
and most importantly to work on ourselve. I chose this remarkably theraputic destination mainly for my reasons on the list below. </h2>


<ul> 
    <li>This destination is away from the city, it is surrounded by nature, but the sophistication of the place will help us with feeling in place.  </li>
    <li>The lodge offers its own life skills coaches, they will assist us with navigating any issues we wish to look at, be it personal or in the benefit of the family </li>
    <li>Meditation classes will be provided every morning in the lodge followed by a massage,breakfast and a jacuzzi bath. </li>
    <li>The place is affordable, we all know COVID19 went deep into our pockets, everything will be coverd at an amount of R850 for the 2 nights, including transportation </li>
    <li>Lastly as we all know we are a family that loves physical activities, the lodge has a secret hiking trial to a large picning spot that will be available for us </li>
</ul>
